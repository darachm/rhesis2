I got to see Daniel Zenkluesen talk about some really exciting work,
published as a pre-print 
[here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/19/237008).
Essentially, they pick a huge mRNA (MDN1, 18kb) and stick cy3 and 
cy5 probes tiled on either the 5' or 3' end (according to figures,
cy5 is 5'). Here's what they see under the (SIM) scope:

The spots don't sit on top one another. This is inconsitent with the
closed-loop model, which is one of those models that's very well
accepted but I don't know exactly what the evidence is. I haven't
read very deeply on it (on the list), but the model is that the
poly-A binding proteins (3' end) associate with the translation
initiation machinery (on the 5' cap) to stimulate a recycling of
ribosomes that just terminate on the 3' then jump back on the 5'.
It makes sense, which makes it very appealing.

But this model is inconsistent with that. The really cool part of 
this work is that they then did drugs to see what would happen.

Cycloheximide has a slight compaction, but puromycin just collapses
the 5' and 3' ends. Cycloheximide freezes ribosomes, and puromycin
causes them to stop and disassociate (what happens to the mRNA
after that? NMD?).
So this suggests that ribosomes are doing the stretching of the 5'
and 3' ends apart, and this is sorta consistent with some nice 
follow-ups with nuclear mRNA and cytoplasmic ncRNA.

The degradation of an mRNA (at least in yeast) largely depends on 
an interaction taking place between the 3' end and the 5' end of
the mRNA. Translation initiation and rapid elongation are 
anti-correlated with degradation. Could ribosomes be keeping these
ends apart, and could their stochastic encounters with their own
(or other) 5'/3' ends trigger decapping and degradation?
