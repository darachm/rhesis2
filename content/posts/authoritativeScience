# Authoritative Science

Fredrick J Ross' wrote a nice book called "Into the Sciences".
One of the most compelling lessons articulated was that of the
transition from student to a practitioner of the scientific process.
In the book, this is described as going from a mode of learning facts
to learning how to question, verify, and make sense of new 
information. He also nicely brought up the case of how science history
tends to be a story of Greats without much of the details of how
that person got to that point with those tools and those people
in that moment. In particular, the underlings and predecessors who
drive a lot of science tend to be forgotten (unless it becomes
advantageous to 
[invoke their plight](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415017055)
).

This interpretation makes a lot of sense to me, that one of the major
challenges to new practitioners is transitioning from learning to
teaching. Some folks aren't well suited for both, and while linked
I think that one is not neccesarily a good predictor of the other.

It started to make even more sense when the 2016 US presidential
primary election started to develop, in particular reading about the 
[rise of American authoritarianism](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism)
in both the field of political science and over the preceeding
50 years of domestic political wrangling.

How so? My theory is that if an academic, 
say an undergrad or grad student,
is challenged and undermined in their confidence, then that academic
may cling to orthodoxy in an act of self-preservation. 
Conversly, only those who are encouraged and emboldened, 
by a personal sense of security but potentially by systemic biases
towards certain groups, are thus able to challenge the accepted
wisdom of the Greats and by doing so either strenghten or reform
this canon.
