### books and the like

- [Can a biologist fix a radio?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1535-6108(02)00133-2)

    In which Yuri Lazebnik convinces us that biologists need to 
    get more quantitatively subtle about how we model processes, 
    lest over-simplify the world. This is not to say that being
    more technically sophisticated is the answer, but I like the
    examples of NPR1, Naomi Ziv's recent paper with Gresham and
    Siegal (out in July Genetics), and the omnigene paper to
    make the point that biology is complicated. Especially in that
    last one, a lot of folks may feel like this is a "no shucks
    sherlock" moment, but those are important moments in the field,
    for everyone to start to accept these ideas as the paradigm
    (so we can get to work questioning them further).

- [Advice to a young scientist](http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.594826)

    Mendawar. Fun.

- [Into the sciences](http://www.librarything.com/work/19756253/book/142780162)

    I like this one. Fred Ross. Should put a link to the crude
    goodbye to the field that pre-empted this book.
    A nice example of self-publishing and a tale from an 
    outsider in biology just arrogant enough to tell it like it is!
    I learned a lot. I really like the "science practicioner"
    phrase. How you train is how you fight, and how you speak is
    how you think, so little turns of phrase can be powerful.

- Chance and Necessity
- The Logic of Chance

### communicating results, analysis, and models

- [Why scientists should write blogs instead of articles](http://www.rolfhut.nl/2016/07/27/why-scientists-should-write-blogs-instead-of-articles/)

    Rolf Hut

- [Slideboards](http://rajlaboratory.blogspot.com/2017/02/introducing-slideboards-tool-for.html)

    A slide-deck-with nice commentary on the side, designed to be
    accessed online without a presenter-human, a la a 
    kiosk/web-poster mode. 
    [A demo!](https://slideboard.herokuapp.com/sparks/14?slide_no=3&question_no=4")


### The doing of science

- [Lessons on doing science from my father, Gerry Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-lessons-from-gerry.html)
    Titus Brown's 

### Technical bits

- [How to Use t-SNE Effectively](http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/)

    t-SNE's a very seductive method for finding structure in data,
    regardless of if it's the kind of structure you think you're 
    looking for. Wattenberg, Vi√©gas, and Johnson have written
    a nice graphical and animated website to best communicate 
    some of the issues. Especially relevant in these
    days of biologists trying to squeeze meaning out of a large
    economic and logistical investment in noisy high-dimensional 
    measurements.
