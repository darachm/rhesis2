Can a university that is a leader in improving teaching offer a
trial run? We take a block of students, we have three modules in
a course. One is baseR, one is tidyR, one is other stats.
They're designed so that they don't feed into each other so much.
Because it would be unethical to withold that dank tidyR magic,
we just vary the timing of presentation using a rotating block
scheme.

They're assessed with challenges at each stage.
