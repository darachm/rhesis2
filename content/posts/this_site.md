This site is typset by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/),
hosted on [NearlyFreeSpeech](https://http://nearlyfreespeech.net/),
and themed on a fork of [Yihui Xie's minimal theme](
  https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin)


It's all setup using the [guide here](
  https://www.penwatch.net/cms/get_started_plain_blog/)
, written by Li-aung “Lewis” Yip.
"A good citizen of the internet" indeed!

The above should work for you if you're setting up your own.
I made an informative mistake in omitting the part of the hook that
pulls down the theme, thinking I was being clever, but had a chance
to learn about git repos not double-tracking theme files.

The below sites were also useful in understanding what all the 
pieces in Li-uang's guide (above) were doing:
