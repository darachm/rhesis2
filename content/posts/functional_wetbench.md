I finally sat down to read the chapter about functions and purrr
in the [Wickham tidyverse book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html).

Functional programming is a paradigm elaborated upon in computer
science, and is a concept of organizing repeated work into
modules of arguments, 

## Biology don't work that way

Biology relies a lot on qualitative models. You can attribute this
to training, or the impossibility of accurately translating
these observations into quantiative models,

# Protocols and Pipelines

Over the last few years, I've made strong improvements to my data
analysis skills. I'm no programmer, but I can get things done.

One of the most frustrating things is that people expect analysis
of disparate datasets from different experiments on different
biology all to be done with a pipeline.

Things change, things are different.

I think the best case for making a black-box pipeline is 
"reproducibility", but not reproducability in the sense of getting
the same result twice (even to setting random seeds similarly, etc).

Rather I think it's a conceptual point, of making an analysis a black
box because that's how some folks think of an instrument. They want
to use a computer like a PCR machine, where you tell it what to do
and it gets it done. Trouble is, just like thermocyclers, garbage in
garbage out.

This philosophical divide, of how familiar scientists want to be with
their apparatus, is apparent in other instrumentation.
