Here I list a few natural-philosophers that I think are interesting.
Some are ancient, and some aren't even dead (at press time).
Some are right, some are wrong, some had great ideas and some
had a combination of methods and deaeanor that inspires me
There's not much more here than would be on wikipedia, but it's
mainly to aggregate these names into one place, for me.
