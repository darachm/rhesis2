Go is a beautifully frustrating game.

The effect of physicality on the pace and fun of the game is a funny
thing. I started by playing on the phone with apps from 
INSERT THOSE TWO
. I played quick, tapping rapidly, and was very frustrated.
Later I went to go buy a set, but the only reasonable priced one
was a cheap magnetic travel kit. Travel meant I could bring it along
and play it against my Partner, but it was hard to move pieces.

Now I dream of making one. 
[Wood would be nice](http://www.kiseido.com/go_equipment.htm), 
but difficult to do
correctly for long term. Short term would be acceptable though, and
a cheap solid base of 2x4 shade-tree cabinetry could be greatly
improved with a proper top. Maybe pegboard?
