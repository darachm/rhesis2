Here I propose a simple experiment, that of trying to run 
pre-print peer-review journal club as a sort of overlay journal.
This is not to make a general solution for science publishing,
but to explore the idea of science publishing on a scale small 
enough to just overlay on existing infrastructure, on the cheap.
A key goal of this is to accelerate peer-review of papers, 
and to save what we learn
from this process in a document of a sort of how-to.

This is similar to a lot of other folk's thoughts and work, 
so let's get in touch if it sounds familiar and we can work together, 
or just chat. Or chuck a citation/link in here.
The main purpose here is to just start talking about it.

[Here's a link to a more thought-out effort on doing pre-print
journal clubs](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SQbmUUaMiBUbCNvq1UeXYNVljIftOcA-W1qGF_cr6Pc/viewform?edit_requested=true), so check that out also.

### What's publishing now? (broad overview)

Currently, scientists do research, write papers, and submit these
to journals. A journal editor decides if it's interesting enough
to send out for review, scientist reviewers donate 
their labor to review the chunk of work, and the work is evaluated
along two major axis: 
that of being interesting or novel enough to be published, 
and that of being good science both technically and in 
interpretation. 
If so, then its published.
This system works to disseminate peer-reviewed chunks of knowledge, 
but it could work better. 

The business model depends on paywalls,
be they after or before publication. This blocks access, and
fundamentally means that the money is coming from library budgets 
(post-publication paywall) or research budgets (pre-publication
paywall).
Remember that the review work is unpaid, so the journal is 
taking both the cash out from library budgets 
via subscriptions but also the salaried time of researchers 
and teachers to do the reviewing work.
The necessity and magnitude of this cost is debated.

The review process is essential, but it takes a while and it's
ususally closed. In the mean time, the work used to be closed off
from the world, although with pre-prints these days this is less of
a problem. Still, the reviews are often closed, which is a shame
given the helpful role this dicussion could play in contextualizing
the work and helping third-parties learn about the technical and
scientific standards of a field. 
[Some folks](http://asapbio.org/open-peer-review) are
working on alternatives in open peer-review.

### Wait ... do pre-prints solve everything?

The surge in popularity of pre-prints has been one of the more
inspiring changes in science for me, and of practical benefit.
Pre-prints becoming a commonplace institution didn't just happen
though, and it took years of folks working on this, so much thanks
are in order. ... but, I'm always a pessimist and I think there's 
a few things to worry about and tweak.

A commonly cited reason for posting a pre-print is 
that it will accelerate scholarship by making the findings 
open sooner to readers,
and I have found this dynamic to be personally useful for my work.
This acceleration goes both ways, with open access offering the 
possibility of helpful feedback to the authors 
(beyond "cite my paper too?"). 
That's the design, but I do hear people complain of a lack of 
feedback or peer review in the pre-print stage.
Peer review of pre-prints would help authors with feedback,
even if it's not authoritative, 
would incentivize sharing results quickly.
This peer review doesn't have to be exclusive with traditional
journal peer review.

Pre-prints have somewhat differentiated themselves from traditional 
publishing but are still largely assumed to being a step on the 
path to traditionally publishing and peer review. 
What I mean is that a pre-print implies that it's going to be 
printed, of course, 
and as such is dependent on the same publishing pipeline of 
edit, review, and recommendation in traditional journals.
Usually with a lab behind it the paper usually gets from 
pre-print to published and gains the authority of formal peer 
review. 
But until then, I'd say that it would be helpful for folks to
get peer-review of pre-prints.

Also, some have now decided to just stop at the pre-print stage 
(an example summarized <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/when-a-preprint-becomes-the-final-paper-1.21333">here, "When a preprint becomes the final paper"</a>).
I think the point that some work doesn't belong in
a traditional journal is good, but I still think an alternative 
peer-review mechanism would still be useful for accelerating 
discussion.

### Can we construct a path to peer-review that lies outside of traditional, profitable journals?

One approach might rely on society-journals going full open-access
([cautiously](http://science-and-food.blogspot.com/2016/03/where-does-scientific-society-money-go.html)).
I'd like that, but I also have scant influence over this development.
Instead, I wonder if publishing can operate on a smaller
scale than full scientific societies or traditional journals?

Some folks are working on just that, with the idea of pre-print
peer review being handled in "an open peer review layer" built on
top of bioRxiv ([Open pre-print peer review](http://asapbio.org/open-peer-review)).
The concept is interesting and timely, but I worry about adopting
new platforms and communication systems that are not currently
in use.

Instead, I'm wondering if we can just organize an overlay journal
that uses a (or hopefully multiple) pre-print journal clubs to 
efficiently get peer-review done in an open way. 
This would overlay on existing infrastructure, so I think its
a matter of organization more than technology.

### So what would this look like?

I am inspired by the overlay journal model, particularly
[Haldane's Sieve](http://haldanessieve.org/)
and
[Discrete Analysis](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2015/09/10/discrete-analysis-an-arxiv-overlay-journal/).
I'm going to sketch out an idea for how this could look at 
steady-state:

- There's a core group of volunteer editors (3 or so), they have an
  an email address, a blog, and a name.
- There's a pool of reviewers, with a mix of different career stages,
  from different research groups, and hopefuly different institutions
  (we can dream). 
- There's a page soliciting submissions, that outlines the aim and 
  scope of the overlay journal, and how to send them papers or links
  to papers.
  ( But first, these editors and reviewers will likely go and 
  find papers on bioRxiv.
  Perhaps these are selected by nomination and voting from the 
  reviewers pool. )

When editors get submission (submitted or found by reviewers or
editors), the editors solict volunteers from the pool of 
reviewers and if needed then follow up with folks on a 
rotating basis (ie you're liable for the editors to harrass 
you every three months, if no one else volunteers).

Review happens from individuals or groups.
Some folks have [experimented with publishing summarized notes
from journal club on a 
blog](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/tag/jclub.html),
and I'd imagine group review would look something like that.

Review should produced as open documents. Given that these 
reviews are fairly low stake, I'm not worried that comments
would be intimidated by the authors, but group review
would allow this to be semi-anonymized. 

If reviewers think the paper is technically correct, then it
and the open review documents are posted on the blog. 

If the reviewers and the editors also agree that it jives
well with the mission of the overlay journal, then it gets
posted in the main output channel as a paper in that journal ...
or perhaps more accurately as a posted link in that blog with
a smily face and a link to the open review.

The key here is that I'm not proposing any new technological tools.
This should done completely as an overlay on top of bioRxiv,
twitter, and an existing blog framework, as adoption of the 
method should be entirely compatible with what people are already
doing. I want to avoid the problem of being pigeonholed in one
platform or another, and avoid that from discouraging use of the 
method.

### Yeah but is it a good idea?

After years of wondering what a post-publication peer-review 
literature would look like, I think this project would establish 
a sketch of a pipeline for peer-review of "pre-prints" that is 
alternative to the traditional for-profit journals. 
However, it's sort of just doing a traditional journal 
on the cheap.

The immediate benefit is that this would provide a mechanism
for folks to get more immediate peer-review on their work
It also makes training opportunities, and keeps everyone engaged in
the latest work in the field.
Hopefully this would provide enough incentive to drive participation
in the review aspect of the effort.

I think this is enough motivation to try it.
But another distinction is that this small psuedo-journal is 
small enough to be mutable in trying different practices. 
In the longer-term I'm interested in
encouraging the publishing of smaller chunks of research, ie making
a place for small but important incremental findings to be shared
with the broader community, instead of gathering dust in 
anticipation of a future student to pick the project back up.
I would also hope to encourage the role of 
review/perspective/blog pieces to tie these incremental results 
together into the broader picture of where the field is going.
There might be a way to respect both of these elements in
contributing to the progress of the work, without requiring that
they exist in one PDF from one research group.
