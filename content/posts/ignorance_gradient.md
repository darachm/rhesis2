This is why machine learning is problematic for science. Statistics
and physics are built on dissecting complex observations to filter
and propose simple models underpinning phenomena. The simplification
process is essential. We cannot all be experts - we cannot always
have a trained mind or machine to make decisions. What we learn about
the world has to be transferred to be effective.
