discretion_is_the_easy_part_of_counting?

intro
The motivation for this thinking comes from thinking about timing in
sample collection. 
</p>

<p>
Often people will collect and present timeseries
with replicates taken and precisely the same times: 0, 5, and 10min.
This, I assume, denotes the time that a sample was taken and a
somewhat reproducible fixation procedure takes place.
When I started to do this, I chose that instead of recording the time
of sample collection to instead record the time of fixation.
While this seems like a small thing, the omission of this data from
prior lab member's work had hidden a very interesting confounding
bit of biology from our analysis, namely the last round of 
transcription before txt synthesis shuts off.
</p>

<p>
So I'm advocating that instead of sampling the discretely-same thing 
over and over, say timepoint 5min exactly time and time again, to
instead sample over continuous time and record exactly when that
happened, with some error of course. Discrepancy between sampling
times should not be blurred and confounded into assumptions of
discretely-identical sampling times, but should be modeled.
</p>

<p>
My thinking about this is well clarified in reading <a href="http://www.biostathandbook.com/variabletypes.html">book on stats</a>.
People treat time as a nominal variable that is set and controlled
by the experimenter. Relinquishing this control in favor of treating
time as a thing to be measured is more honest.
</p>

<p>
Now I'm trying to think of how this all fits into transposon 
mutagenesis.
