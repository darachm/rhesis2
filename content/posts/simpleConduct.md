In the article [Power Causes Brain Damage](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/power-causes-brain-damage/528711/),
Useem describes studies of a "power paradox", a theory advanced 
by Dacher Keltner. The idea is that when people get power and
feel safe in their power, they lose the skills that got them
entrusted with the power. MRI work by Sukhvinder Obhi suggests
that this results from a loss of "mirroring", and other results
point towards powerful people having lost the ability to know what
other people are thinking/feeling.

Knowing what other people think, or what they would think if
you did something, is an invaluable skill. It can keep you from 
pissing someone off, or it can be used to manipulate people.
Like anything, it's a means, not an end. But it's essential for
being a leader. I agree with Simon Sinek's idea that 
competent leaders figure out, instinctively or not,
what the people they're responsible for fear and need, then they
watch everyone's back so that everyone can focus on getting the work
done. 

So why does this atrophy? I just finished [this book about Willpower](https://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Rediscovering-Greatest-Human-Strength),
[recommended by Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/productivity-tips-hints-hacks-tricks-for-grad-students-academics/).
The take away
 
I ride a bike in and out of Manhattan every workday. My favorite
thing is when I can get someone to pass me multiple times without
me passing them. This requires me to take sneaky shortcuts,
and for them to be chompy. "Chompy" is a word I picked up, I think
from around the bike polo people, but I can't remember clearly.
To chomp means to exert excess effort, exuberance, without 
efficiency of effect. For me, it's just a shortening of the phrase
"chomping at the bit", like a horse that's bucking to go and just
chomps the bit.


pathway, usually shortcuts, such that the other cyclist must
ride harder and faster than I in order to complete the same path.
It does not count if I pass them by bicycling harder, I must 
only be passed.  
The max I remember I've gotten is four passes,
usually 3, two is memorable for the day, and one of course is not.

Those who are most susceptible to this are those I would refer to
as "chomping", ie those expending great amounts of effort,
"chomping at the bit", but without much effect. I think this 
principle applies more broadly.

In the I Ching,
hexagram 10, changing line 1, Wilhem-Baynes, tweaked, says: 
> When a person is dissatisfied with modest circumstances, 
> the person is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, 
> not for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, 
> but merely in order to escape from lowliness and poverty by 
> dint of conduct. Once his purpose is achieved, they are certain 
> to become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore blame attaches 
> to their progress. On the other hand, a person who is good at 
> their work is content to behave simply. They wish to make 
> progress in order to accomplish something. When they attains 
> the goal, he does something worth while, an all is well.
