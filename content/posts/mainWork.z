<p>
Fiddling about to figure out what dumps GAP1 mRNA during
a nitrogen upshift.
The current approach is doing high-throughput yeast genetics with
mRNA FISH, FACS, and the barcoded deletion collection.
We hope to uncover an example of tradeoffs of cost and benefit of
a regulatory strategy for rapidly switching phenotypes during
environmental changes.

A talk about it!

Very interested in <i>de novo</i> mutagenesis amenable to 
affordable types of sequencer-counting. I think transposons is
the way to go in yeast...
