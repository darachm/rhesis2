# Artisinal goods are anti-worker

http://smbc-comics.com/comic/the-future

Artisinal goods are complicit in the economic structures required to
keep large swaths of our populace pinned in futile production cycles.
Admitedly and fortuitously, I'd imagine those engaged in "artisnal"
labor is fairly small, but the notion of valuing "craftsmenship" more 
than the craftsperson is abhorent.
