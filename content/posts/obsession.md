[^looseCannon]: [loose cannon](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=loose%20cannon)

"Don't clone alone!" is a common phrase in molecular biology labs.
Going it alone is tempting, but whether it be at the level of 
a paper or in designing an experiment peer-review is essential for
keeping you sane.

Here's a tweet that resonated with my experiences in periods of 
being connected or alone from other researchers:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dyson: Einstein and Dirac became intellectually sterile in their later careers because they looked for beauty and ignored reality. <a href="https://t.co/s4w2VIO9Sk">pic.twitter.com/s4w2VIO9Sk</a></p>&mdash; Ashutosh Jogalekar (@curiouswavefn) <a href="https://twitter.com/curiouswavefn/status/878019607549943808">June 22, 2017</a></blockquote>

In later replies, @JonHBiotech said that Kepler was the same way
about "sacred geometry". This reminds me of Asimov and alchemy,
and also [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/power-causes-brain-damage/528711/)
that describes how individuals that rise to being alone at the
top of the pile.
Once alone, they atrophy, and I'd imagine that
for scientists this comes from secluding one's self from very
critical peer-review.

### ignorance gradients power investigation &amp; learning

At every level of doing science, we see the mentor-mentee 
relationship, PI &amp; post-docs, post-docs &amp; grad students, 
grad students &amp; undergrads, or other combinations.
In some ways this hierarchy can be criticized, but just as life
thrives on a gradient so does science thrive on a gradient of
ignorance.
For the mentee, the guidance is obviously helpful. 
For the mentor, the 
constraint of obligation [^exper] focuses an uncanalyzed storm of 
possibilities into objectives and actions of necessity.
On the group-selection level, a diverse composition of a lab 
helps balance current and future productivity [^labComp], and
I'd imagine this happens because a diversity of skills also
means that there's lots of ignorance-gradients that encourage
learning + investigation.

[^exper]:
( I say this with the experience of mentoring a high school student,
a summer undergrad, and a split-mentorship with another undergrad.
I also have [two cats](http://www.rhesis.com/gatos.html),
and the obligation to leave the lab and fed
them in the evenings is of a value that should not be discounted. )

[^labComp]: referring to 
    [this study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2015.01.001), 
    [summarized &amp; contextualized here](http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.caredit.a1500057)
    .

Lee Hood founded the Institute for Systems Biology, after doing
lots of good stuff with automated sequencers in earlier years
(amongst other things). I did a summer intership where he gave a
talk about his path in science. He emphasized that he would switch
fields about every ten years or so, just jump to something new.
He's an example of a scientist who's aged well (stayed sane 
and focused), and I wonder if continuily jumping to new fields
allows him to access the mentee role in learning, and so maintain
his connection to peers.

Constantly jumping into new pools is one way to keep flowing
through the progression of a scientist, and to keep surfing 
along the ignorance gradient.
But understand that you need two to tango, the mentor and the
mentee.

### So maybe that's advice for the top-bosses of science, but what about for us? 

I think the key is to just stay aware and make sure you
don't get off alone by yourself. It's easy to do, but research is
better if you can take the time to get connected with other 
researchers.

Are you alone in your research? 
Do two things: talk to other people and talk to yourself:

- Other people are easier. Swing by other scientists and other 
labs and 
[shoot the breeze](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shoot%20the%20breeze)
and complain, but also give them space/time to vent. 
Other people's problems and most importantly their paths to
solutions are (sometimes) very illuminating.
Do you find this awkward? Try to find if there's happy hours or
some in, some excuse?
- But maybe if you're really really alone and don't have options, 
then try to seperate the doing from planning (see 
[OODA loop theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) ). 
What I mean is that you need to set out the time to (1) stop doing
things and (2) adopt as far removed of an outside persepctive as
you can manage so that you can (3) re-orient and decide what should
be done without being in the thick of research.
