I spent a lot of my phd working on skills that I did not need to work
on, suffering frustrations that I could have bypassed, and all
together spending too much time flitting between half-baked ideas
instead of investing the time and care to make one good idea happen.
I took these lessons as a sharp disciplinary rap, and now have ideas
of how I _ought_ to do things. One of these things is writing.

People say to start papers by making figures. I say they've skipped
over writing the introduction, because often people already know
what they're doing and why. If you're not 100% sure, or you don't
have people giving you the critical work-over to make sure you're
sure, then you should start on the intro as you start on the project.
Duh!

Start a big document. Read papers. Write notes, with quotes under
the citations in the big document. Write thoughts. Dump it down.
Never delete, but laboriously re-organize.

Once you have a giant master, then outline it. Then arrange the
outline and the notes, and repeat. Decide what goes in the misc bin
at the end.
