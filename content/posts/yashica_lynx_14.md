I had this camera in the bottom of my electronics box for ~8 years,
ever since someone left it behind in a house I was living at.

Stuck shutter. I had looked it up back when I first got it and saw
some sites that supposed it would be real easy to clean and unstick
the shutter, but I couldn't get

Was gonna move, just got a pin spanner

Thanks to the 
[comprehensive guide from Mike Eckman](http://www.mikeeckman.com/2016/11/yashica-lynx-14-1965/),
I was able to navigate the insides.
