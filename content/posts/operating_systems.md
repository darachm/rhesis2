I have finally decided to get of Arch. I am grateful to have learned
so much, but it's god-damn awful to have a perl update break all the
handshakes for everything days before important drafts are due.

That ain't what it's for, so maybe it's time I oughta split.
Or just use the nice safe distributions with training wheels[^tw],
like Ubuntu.

[^tw]: people testing it
