Biology is in a reproducibility crisis - who can me more reproducible
first?

I'm joking, but it's heartening to see researchers focusing a lot of
attention on how to make analyses reproducible between labs.
I've got swept up in this, sort of, but for unconciously different
reasons.

A graphical user's interface with a point and click interface gives
me great anxiety. It's probably the perfectionist inside me, but
how the heck am I going to draw a perfectly straight line on a
diagram? I'd rather type in two coordinates, in something like
\LaTeX.

For me, scripting everything to make it entirely reproducible is
producibility, ie that I ain't going to get it done unless it's
scripted.

# The virtues of explicit content

There's something fundamentally good about making your methods,
models, and analysis explicit. If you can't express it in
words, is it really all there? It reminds me of the quincunx
question, why does the enormous variety of phenotypes that a
system can take, why does this variety get compressed back down
into simpler DNA code every generation?

Is reproducibile science making science more like biology?
The germline of scripts for analysis are differentiated into
particular configurations, then compute an output?
