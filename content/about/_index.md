is a phd student finishing up work in David Gresham's lab at NYU.
Darach is trying to figure out the extent, mechanisms, and role
of stability control in reprogramming the budding yeast transcriptome
upon an upshift in growth.
Darach does wetbench, bioinformatics, bikes, and has lived in a 
linux box for about 7 years (ubuntu, crunchbang, arch).
Darach likes `\LaTeX`, but mostly does everything through 
`rmarkdown` and `pandoc`.
