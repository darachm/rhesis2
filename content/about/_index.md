This is part personal website, part personal website that's looking
to get hired. Interesting bits are up in posts, or more likely posts
by tags. Links are links to more interesting things.

I'm a phd student finishing up work in David Gresham's lab at NYU, 
trying to figure out the extent, mechanisms, and role
of stability control in reprogramming the budding yeast transcriptome
upon an upshift in growth (nitrogen upshift).
I do wetbench, bioinformatics, bikes, and some computer stuff.

I like a good 25:24:1 back-extraction and think "HiFi" polymerases
are finiky.
I ride a '90 stumpjumper comp with big tyres and 
upside-down thumbies.
I've lived in a linux box for about 7 years 
<!-- since ubuntu 10.10, 2010-10-10 -->
(ubuntu, crunchbang, arch), and like `\LaTeX` 
(but mostly do everything through `pandoc`).
My favorite book is the Tao Te Ching translated by UK LeGuin.
